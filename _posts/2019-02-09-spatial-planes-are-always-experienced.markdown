Spatial planes are always experienced multidimensionally, because experience itself is multidimensional. The limits of representational language can catalyse a rapture; dimensions collapsing into fewer. 

A cube becomes a distended set of squares. What does being become when flattened into language? 

When I was a child I used to stare at the sun. What stopped me.

Dope town drunk. 

This isn’t a website really. It’s not a portfolio. Is it a confession? An apology, maybe. It’s time and energy I’ve put into a medium that you’re now spending time and energy reading. Honestly, I’m just sorta reaching out. 

Yeah I’m not selling anything right now. It’s okay to be the collaborator rather than the artist. Grow beyond binaries? 

Ah, this is all just virtue signalling anyway. That’ll do, it’s okay.
